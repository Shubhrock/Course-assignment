    "# Something measured on an \"ordinal\" scale does have an evaluative connotation. One value is greater or larger or better than the other. Product A is preferred over product B, and therefore A receives a value of 1 and B receives a value of 2. \n",
    "# Another example might be rating your job satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 representing complete satisfaction. With ordinal scales, we only know that 2 is better than 1 or 10 is better than 9; we do not know by how much. It may vary. The distance between 1 and 2 maybe shorter than between 9 and 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interval\n",

    "# it is absolute zero. Weight is another example, 0 lbs. is a meaningful absence of weight. Your bank account balance is another. Although you can have a negative or positive account balance, there is a definite and nonarbitrary meaning of an account balance of 0."
